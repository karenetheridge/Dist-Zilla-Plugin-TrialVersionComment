=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TrialVersionComment - Add a "# TRIAL" comment after your version declaration in trial releases

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [TrialVersionComment]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that munges your F<.pm> files to add a
C<# TRIAL> comment after C<$VERSION> assignments, if the release is C<--trial>.

If the distribution is not a C<--trial> release (i.e. C<release_status> in
metadata is C<stable>), this plugin does nothing.

=for stopwords PkgVersion OurPkgVersion RewriteVersion

Other plugins that munge versions into files also add the C<# TRIAL> comment (such as
L<[PkgVersion]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion>,
L<[OurPkgVersion]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion>, and
L<[RewriteVersion]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion>, so you would
generally only need this plugin if you added the version yourself, manually.

Nothing currently parses these comments, but the idea is that things like
L<Module::Metadata> might make use of this in the future.
